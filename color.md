# Color Calibration (For Displays)
## Obtain ArgyllCMS
[ArgyllCMS website](https://www.argyllcms.com/)
> Validate your distro package is current (>3.0). If you have errors relating to unreadable files, they likely relate to a bug in the older version's unicode handling.
{.is-warning}

> So you have record of what you've done, make sure your bash history is immediately appending.

## Adjust display (if display has menu)
### Purpose
If the display has a color adjustment menu, adjusting the color there will result in more accurate colors for devices without the display's profile, as well as minimze the corrections necessary in the profile. `dispcal` will be used to show the distance from ideal (aka delta E, DE, or Î”E). The user is encourage it switch between optimizing black and white, as optimizing for only one leads the other to skew quite heavily. Find the least bad.

### Command
`dispcal`

## Generate targets (targen)
### Purpose
`targen` will generate a list of color patches for `dispread`. The idea is that it is impossible to reasonably test the entire colorspace, so representative points (colors) are picked for calibration. There is a bias in sampling towards the white spectrum (what are called color temperatures) and blacks due to perception bias.
### Command
Example:
`targen -v -d3 -G -w -V 1.25 -f 2048 -c ../Display.icc Display`

Arguments:
`-v` Verbose
`-d3` Display Type (Video RGB)
`-G` Optimise point placement
`-w` Generate html file showing point placement. Cool to look at. May be omited.
`-V 1.25` Bias slightly towards darker colors and blacks.
`-f 2048` Number of points to generate. Bigger is better but slower. 2k is a good number for high quality, 200 is fast and dirty.
`-c ../Display.icc` If you have an existing display profile, using that here may produce more optimal point selection. May be omitted.
`Display` Will be the filename (Display.ti1) as well as being the name encoded in the file.
> The filename argument must be last! Any arguments after will be ignored.{.is-warning}

## Generate calibration factors (dispread)
### Purpose
`dispread` will take a list of points generated by `targen` and measure the display's response.

### Command
Example:
`dispread -d 1 -v -K ../Display.cal Display`

Arguments:
`-d 1` Select first display. Run dispread without any arguments to see the list of displays.
`-v` Verbose
`-K ../Display.cal` If you've run dispcal or this process before, include this argument, pointing to your .cal file. This speeds up calibration by suggesting calibration values. May be omited.
`Display` Will be the filename (Display.ti3), the name encoded in the file, and the name of the input file generated by targen.
> The filename argument must be last! Any arguments after will be ignored.{.is-warning}
